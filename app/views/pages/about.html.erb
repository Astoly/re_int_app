      </div>
      <p class="lead">Reading Intelligence is a digital infrastructure, where readings can be requested and answered within a short frame of time. Every reading request is sent to a pool of 20-30 people from the Sharing-the-Presence-Field, who offer their intuitive intelligence as a free service. You can post your problem or question via Smartphone or Notebook, take a picture of yourself send your request through the net. Within 48 hours you will receive two readings from different readers, to whom you can give a feedback afterwards.</p>

      <p class="lead">The impulse to initiate the project came from our experience that giving readings is not only a powerful and highly valuable service to the community but it also deepens the subtle competencies of the reader. In addition, it often goes along with a natural sense of joy and aliveness. We experience readings as a process of abundance that creates an “energetic win-win situation” for reader and receiver - both benefit from a deepening and opening of intelligence. So why not use the motivation of so many people in the field to practice and to deepen their reading abilities while offering it as a service to the community at the same time?</p>
